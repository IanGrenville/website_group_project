# Requirements:

For the SOCS server implementation, this has already been done! Therefore, skip to command line startup!

Upon downloading, please ensure the following:
sudo apt install npm
git clone https://github.com/tpiggo/website_group_project.git
npm install

The last line will ensure are dependencies are installed prior to running. 
  
# Command line Startup
To run the application on port 8016, use the following command:
npm run start

In order to run in the development mode (also on 8016), the following command should be used:  
npm run dev
