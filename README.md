# Notes
The McGill School of Computer Science website was needing of a remastering. A project was proposed during the COMP 307 course to rebuild the website, therefore, a group a students undertook the project! The full stack project was done with limited to no knowledge of the technology stack being implemented, a huge learning curve for everyone involved!  
Please create a new branch from the main in order to get develop some aspect of the project. main will be updated when patches need to be done
however, it should always be a clean, working version of the website. Therefore, in order to not cause issues, use branches.
